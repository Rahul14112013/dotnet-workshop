Cloud Native .Net and Steeltoe workshop

In this one-day workshop, learn  how to create cloud-native applications with .NET. You'll hear about patterns and anti-patterns, and then put hands on keyboard to put best practices into action. We’ll talk about .NET Framework, .NET Core, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and the  Steeltoe library for microservices. Whether your .NET apps are staying on-premises or moving to a public cloud, these principles will help you build more scalable, resilient, and adaptable systems that drive your competitive advantage.

By the end of the day, you’ll get exposed to what you need for refactoring existing .NET apps, and building entirely new ones in a cloud-native way.
